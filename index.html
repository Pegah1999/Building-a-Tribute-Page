            Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologists in Mexico
            on how to increase wheat yields - part of his life-long war on
            hunger.

        <h4>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h4>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="year">1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li></br>
                <li><span class="year">1938</span> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li></br>
                <li><span class="year">1941</span> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li></br>
                <li><span class="year">1942</span> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li></br>
                <li><span class="year">1944</span> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li></br>
                <li><span class="year">1945</span> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li></br>
                <li><span class="year">1953</span> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li></br>
